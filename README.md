# NSClient++ documentation

The NSClient++ documentation is written in GitHub flavored [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
It is located in the `docs/` directory and can be edited with your preferred editor. You can also
edit it online on GitHub.

```
vim docs/installing.md
```

In order to review and test changes, you can install the [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) Python library.

```
pip install mkdocs
```

Note: Use at least 0.16, 0.14 has this [bug](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1213).

This allows you to start a local mkdocs viewer instance on http://localhost:8000

```
mkdocs serve
```

Changes on the chapter layout can be done inside the `mkdocs.yml` file in the main tree.
