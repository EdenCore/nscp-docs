  What's New in NSClient++ 0.4.4
*********************************

:Author: Michael Medin

.. |release| replace:: 0.4.3

Introduction
============

The main goals of the 0.4.4 was to get the new installer out.

 * New installer
 
**PLEASE NOTE** NRPE has been changed (from 0.4.3), for details read below.

Improved installer
------------------

A reworked installer with support for monitoring tools have been added. Currently only op5 is supported but the plan is t suppot other tools as well.
The installer also has a much improved command line itnerface as well as a lt of bug fixes.

NRPE enhancements (0.4.3)
-------------------------

**If you are using NRPE you are in for a chock!**

::

  In 0.4.3 we will no longer support the rather insecure regular NRPE! 
  You can still enable support but you have to do so (in the installer or using the command line mode). 
  So keep a heads up when you run the installer so you wont miss it.

The idea is that when NSClient++ ships a new check_nrpe will be provided which wont have the limitations of the old one.
