*********************************

:Author: Michael Medin

.. |release| replace:: 0.4.1

Introduction
============

The main goal of the 0.4.2 update is to create a new modern check subsystem.
This means all checks will get:
 * help command linte options to get help
 * proper documentation
 * the same or similar syntax
 * "real-time" options in many instances

Documentation
-------------

Compleatly new documentation tool chain (your reading the result).

**Status:** Essentially done...

New windows subsystem
---------------------

The windows subsystem in < 0.4.2 is optimized for Windows NT and really needs an overhaul.
 * Support for remote checking of windows machines (ie. allow NSCLient++ act as a broker and check remote machines in an agent-less fashion)
 * Support for Modern Windows (vista and beyond)
 * Drop support for "Legacy Windows" (will still be available as-is in but not updated/get extended support)
 * Support real-time monitoring in more instances

**Status:** In progress...

Monitoring Kits
---------------

The script support will be extended to include "monitoring kits" which is a concept of installable easy to configure monitoring patterns. The idea is that this should be enough to setup a new SQL server which has two databases foo and bar.

.. code-block:: text

  nscp py --script sql-server --install --db foo --db bar --report nsca

**Status:** Not started...
